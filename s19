Chapter Nineteen, of how the Spaniards ordered the Indians to hold the festivity of Huitzilopochtli; this was in the absence of the Captain, when he went to the port because of the arrival of Panfi1o de Narvaez.
When Captain don Hernando Cortes departed for the port to receive Panfi)o de
Narvaez, he left in his place, with the
Spaniards who remained here in Mexico,
don Pedro de Alvarado, who, in the absence of the Captain, encouraged Moteuccoma to order the festivity of Huitzilopochtli to be held, because they wanted to
see how they performed these ceremonies.
Moteuccoma ordered this festivity to be
held to give pleasure to the Spaniards.
Thus the satraps, as well as the leaders, prepared themselves to hold the festivity.
In all this subsequent text, nothing else
is said except the way they made the statue
of Huitzilopochtli from the dough of various vegetables, how they painted it, how they arranged it, and how afterward they offered many things before it. During the ceremonies all the leaders,
very richly costumed, were performing a great dance in the great square of the cu of
Huitzilopochtli where the image made of
amaranth dough was, very richly decorated
with many ornaments, which are explained in the text, as well as other ceremonies that are included throughout this
whole chapter.
