Chapter Twenty, of how the Spaniards
performed a great slaughter of the Indians
while they were celebrating the festivity of
Huitzilopochtli in the square of that same
Huitzilopochtli.
At the time that seemed opportune to
them, the Spaniards came out from where
they had been and took all the gates to the
square so that no one could get out. Others
entered with their weapons and began to
kill those who were in the dance. They cut
off the hands and heads of those who were
playing instruments. They stabbed and
lanced everyone they encountered, performing a very great slaughter. Those who
ran fleeing to the gates were killed there.
Some leaped over the walls. Some went
into the chapels of the c11s, where they lay
down and played dead. Blood ran in the
square like water when it rains. The whole
square was strewn with heads, arms, intestines, and dead bodies. The Spaniards
searched in all the corners for those alive,
to kill them.
When word of this deed got out into
the city, they began to call out, saying,
"To arms! To arms!" At this shouting a
large number of people assembled, all with
their weapons, and they began to fight
against the Spaniards.
